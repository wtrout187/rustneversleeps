## Security Best Practices

When using Ollama Rust UI:

1. **Network Security**: Only connect to trusted Ollama instances
2. **Local Access**: The application is designed for local use with localhost Ollama
3. **Model Safety**: Be cautious with the models you use and the data you input
4. **System Resources**: Monitor system resources during stress testing

## Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine the affected versions
2. Audit code to find any potential similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all releases still under maintenance
4. Release new versions with security fixes
5. Publicly announce the vulnerability after fixes are available

Thank you for keeping Ollama Rust UI and our users safe!
