**The most advanced, beautiful, and performant LLM benchmarking tool ever built.**

*Think Activity Monitor met GPT, had a baby, and Steve Jobs personally designed the UX.*

## 🌟 Why This Changes Everything

> *"This isn't just a tool—it's a revolution in how we understand LLM performance."*

🎯 **The Problem:** Current LLM benchmarking tools are clunky, slow, and provide zero insights into real-world performance.

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- **macOS** (optimized for dual-core i5 MacBooks)
- **Rust** 1.70+ (Install: <https://rustup.rs/>)
- **Ollama** (Install: <https://ollama.ai/>)
- **Models**: `qwen-contract:latest` and `qwen-contract-q5:latest`

### 🎯 Quick Start (60 seconds to awesome)

```bash
# 1. Clone this masterpiece
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ollama-rust-ui.git
cd ollama-rust-ui

# 2. Install dependencies (Cargo handles everything)
cargo build --release

# 3. Start Ollama (if not running)
ollama serve

# 4. Launch the revolution
cargo run --release
```

### 🔧 Model Setup

```bash
# Download the Q4 model (smaller, faster)
ollama pull qwen-contract:latest

# Download the Q5 model (larger, more accurate)
ollama pull qwen-contract-q5:latest
```

## 🎮 Usage Guide

### 🚀 Basic Workflow

1. **Connection Test**: Click `🔍 Test Connection` to verify Ollama
2. **Pre-load Models**: Click `🔄 Pre-load Models` for maximum speed
3. **Single Request**: Type a prompt, select model, click `Send Request`
4. **Parallel Compare**: Click `🚀 Compare Both Models` for side-by-side analysis
5. **Stress Test**: Click `⚡ Stress Test` to push your system to the limits

### 🎯 Pro Tips

- **Pre-load First**: Always pre-load models before serious testing
- **Watch the Cooldown**: 5-second cooldown prevents system overload
- **Monitor RAM**: Keep an eye on the performance stats panel
- **Use Parallel Mode**: Compare models simultaneously for accurate benchmarks
- **Check History**: Review performance trends in the analytics panel

## 🔧 Configuration

### 🎨 Default Settings

```rust
ollama_url: "http://localhost:11434"
q4_model: "qwen-contract:latest"
